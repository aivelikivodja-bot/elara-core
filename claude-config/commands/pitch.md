Evaluate a product or feature idea using the structured framework.

Use the idea evaluation framework at ~/.claude/projects/-home-neboo/memory/idea-framework.md

$ARGUMENTS contains the idea to evaluate. If no arguments provided, ask what idea to evaluate.

Steps:
1. Search the web for 3-5 competing products/features
2. Score the idea on all 5 axes (Problem, Market, Effort, Monetization, Strategic Fit)
3. Define the MVP scope (smallest useful version)
4. Give an honest recommendation: Build / Plan / Pass

Be direct. Don't hype. If the idea is bad, say so and explain why.
