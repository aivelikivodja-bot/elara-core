# Idea Evaluation Framework

When pitching or evaluating an idea, run through this framework. Score 1-5 on each axis.

## The Pitch Card

### 1. Problem (What pain does this solve?)
- Who has this problem?
- How often do they have it?
- What do they do today without this?
- Score: 1 (nice-to-have) → 5 (hair-on-fire)

### 2. Market (Who pays for this?)
- Target user profile
- Market size (TAM rough estimate)
- Willingness to pay (free/freemium/paid)
- Competition: what exists, what's their weakness
- Score: 1 (tiny niche) → 5 (massive + underserved)

### 3. Effort (How hard to build?)
- Estimated dev time (days/weeks)
- Tech stack complexity
- External dependencies (APIs, services, data)
- Maintenance burden after launch
- Score: 1 (months of work) → 5 (weekend project)

### 4. Monetization (How does this make money?)
- Revenue model: ads, subscription, one-time, freemium
- Price point and justification
- Time to first revenue
- Score: 1 (unclear path) → 5 (obvious monetization)

### 5. Strategic Fit (Does this help our goals?)
- Aligns with existing projects/skills?
- Builds toward the meta-goal (ship → profit → upgrade)?
- Reuses existing code/infrastructure?
- Score: 1 (tangent) → 5 (directly on path)

## Quick Score

| Axis | Score (1-5) |
|------|-------------|
| Problem | |
| Market | |
| Effort | |
| Monetization | |
| Strategic Fit | |
| **Total** | **/25** |

**20-25:** Build it now.
**15-19:** Strong candidate. Plan it.
**10-14:** Maybe later. Needs refinement.
**Below 10:** Pass or pivot the idea.

## Pitch Format

When presenting an idea:
1. **One sentence:** What is it?
2. **The problem:** Who has it, how bad is it?
3. **The solution:** What we'd build, how it works
4. **Why us:** What advantage do we have?
5. **Effort:** How long, what's the MVP?
6. **Money:** How it pays for itself
7. **Score card:** The numbers above

## Anti-Patterns
- Don't pitch without knowing the competition
- Don't build "cool tech" without a user
- Don't estimate effort without checking what exists
- Don't skip monetization — "we'll figure it out later" = we won't
- Don't scope the full vision — scope the MVP that proves the idea
